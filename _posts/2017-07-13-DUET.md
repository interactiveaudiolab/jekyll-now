The first source separation algorithm we're going to explore in the _nussl blog_ is the Degenerate Unmixing Extraction Technique, or DUET. This algorithm was first proposed by Scott Rickard, et al [1, 2, 3] in the early 2000s. As you can problably guess by its name, DUET requires _two_ slightly different recordings of the same mixture. Luckily, this is often the case in stereo recordings. In a nutshell, DUET separates sources by examining differences in attenuation and delay between each channel in a stereo mixture. This mirrors the auditory systems in many animals (humans included) and is one of the many source separation algorithms that echoes psychoacoustic processes.
